## 1. Executive Summary
Provide a concise overview of the proposal. This section should clearly state the technology being proposed and the primary problem it intends to address.

## 2. Problem Statement
Detail the limitations of the current technology stack or the specific engineering challenges that necessitate a new solution. This section must rely on objective data (e.g., latency metrics, development velocity bottlenecks) rather than subjective preference.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Describe the technology to be adopted. detailed the architectural fit, integration strategy, and how it resolves the issues identified in the Problem Statement.

## 4. Alternative Solutions Analysis
List alternative technologies that were evaluated but rejected.

| Solution | Key Advantages | Key Disadvantages | Rejection Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Alternative A]** | ... | ... | ... |
| **[Alternative B]** | ... | ... | ... |

## 5. Strategic Evaluation (The 6 Pillars)
